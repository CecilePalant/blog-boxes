Blog Boxes Task Instructions
=========

- Read the comments in the `blog-boxes.cs` file
- You can complete the task in C# or adapt it to any other programming language, however if you do, be sure to:
  - Write a similar driver file (like blog-boxes.cs)
  - Provide instructions on how to compile/run the source code along with any dependencies
  - Use comments to discuss any design decisions you've made and why
- Final deliverable should include:
  - All necessary project files
  - A README.md with the following information:
    - List of dependencies and how to install them
    - Instructions to compile/run the code
- Turn-in Options
  - Email us at `jobs@dragonbox.com`
  - Zip up and share or email (most likely you will need to rename the .Zip extension to attach it to email)
  - A shared private git repo is fine
  - A directory file share (e.g. Google Drive, DropBox) is also fine
- Note: Dockerized solutions are fine (and preferable if the environmental setup is complicated)
